LED Driver: 
 48 * MBI5026CF 16-bit Constant Current LED Driver (Datasheet available online) 
 (6 Rows of 8, RGB1 and RGB2)
 Max refresh rate 25Mhz per channel (6 channels RBG1 and RGB2)
  3 Potentiometers on back allow adjustment of Red, Green and Blue brightness levels for board color matching, etc.

Notes on driving:
These panels can be driven by common hobbyist micro-controllers or better and require at minimum 9 I/O lines. For 3 channel PWM brightness control you'll need 11. Because the panels pass data from one to the next adding more panels will still only require 9-11 I/O pins, however your refresh rate is reduced with more panels added due to needing to send more pixel data between each refresh.

The panels are split into an upper half and lower half arrays which are 8 x 16 pixels in dimensions.
In practice the clock, output enable and latch lines from the upper half and lower half of the panel can be tied together because the boards have a buffer chip (74LS245 Octal Bus Transceiver used as a simple 1 way driver) to drive all of the MBI5026GF LED driver chips.

Brightness can be controlled globally using PWM on the Output Enable Lines.
